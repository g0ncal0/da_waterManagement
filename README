- The parser isn't tested. Also, I think I'll need to change some things with the >>, because I'm not skipping the commas in subsequent >> reads for ints, when I think I should.

- Some functions have been implemented as return 0 meaning success. Maybe this isn't consistent with some others...


## Questions:
- What is done? What is not done?
- Do we have reverse edges everywhere? A city may have a connection to another city?
    - Did we use cities as a place that can transport water: water comes from left and goes to right, passing the city?
- Getactualdelivery vs getdelivery?
- What are the structs used for?
