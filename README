- In the future, we may need to handle memory garbage due to Graph creation of vertexes.

- The parser isn't tested. Also, I think I'll need to change some things with the >>, because I'm not skipping the commas in subsequent >> reads for ints, when I think I should.

- Some functions have been implemented as return 0 meaning success. Maybe this isn't consistent with some others...
